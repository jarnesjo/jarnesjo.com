Here comes another post about Github actions and deployment to Digital Ocean. This is from this site
which is deployed with exactly this manner.

## Why don't just go with Vercel?

It's a valid question and I have done in this way because

1. Want to learn and get a better understanding of Github Actions
2. Want to learn Docker
3. I/[We](https://webready.se) have most of our sites on Digital Ocean

## Dockerfile

With this config you build multi stage environment, but in my case I only do it with production.

```docker:Dockerfile
# Source: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/16995#discussioncomment-132339

# Install dependencies only when needed
FROM node:lts-alpine AS deps

WORKDIR /opt/app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci

# Rebuild the source code only when needed
FROM node:lts-alpine AS builder

# Add Google Analytics to client code
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=$NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID

ENV NODE_ENV=production
WORKDIR /opt/app
COPY . .
COPY --from=deps /opt/app/node_modules ./node_modules
RUN npm run build

# Production image, copy all the files and run next
FROM node:lts-alpine AS runner

WORKDIR /opt/app
ENV NODE_ENV=production
COPY --from=builder /opt/app/next.config.js ./
COPY --from=builder /opt/app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /opt/app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /opt/app/node_modules ./node_modules

# Next.js collects completely anonymous telemetry data about general usage.
# Learn more here: https://nextjs.org/telemetry
# Uncomment the following line in case you want to disable telemetry.
# ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1

CMD ["node_modules/.bin/next", "start"]
```

## Github action

Here we are using Github package registry to distribute the package and the login to Digital Ocean
and deploy it. All the **secrets** in this file are described below.

```yml:.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml
name: Build and Deploy

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      logLevel:
        description: "Log level"
        required: true
        default: "warning"

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: node:14

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build and Publish to Github Packages Registry
        uses: elgohr/Publish-Docker-Github-Action@master
        env:
          NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID: ${{ secrets.APP_NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID }}
        with:
          name: jarnesjo/jarnesjo.com/nextjs
          registry: docker.pkg.github.com
          username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          dockerfile: Dockerfile
          buildargs: NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID
          tags: latest

      - name: Deploy package to digitalocean
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
        env:
          GITHUB_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_USER }}
          key: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}
          port: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_PORT }}
          envs: GITHUB_USERNAME, GITHUB_TOKEN
          script: |
            docker login docker.pkg.github.com -u $GITHUB_USERNAME -p $GITHUB_TOKEN
            docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/jarnesjo/jarnesjo.com/nextjs:latest
            docker stop jarnesjo.com
            docker system prune -f
            docker run --name jarnesjo.com -dit -p 3000:3000 docker.pkg.github.com/jarnesjo/jarnesjo.com/nextjs:latest
```

### Github secrets

```
APP_NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID - Google Analytics code injected to client code
DEPLOY_HOST - IP to Digital Ocean (DO) droplet
DEPLOY_KEY - SSH secret and the public key should be added to `.ssh/authorized_keys` on server
DEPLOY_PORT - SSH port (22)
DEPLOY_USER  - User on droplet (for Forge: `forge`)
USERNAME - Your Github username
```

Hope it can give you inspiration to your setup up and if you don't want to go with standard Vercel
setup.
