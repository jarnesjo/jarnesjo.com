Almost every webpage or app uses form in any form or another. And more and more people are uses
theirs mobiles as primary device for it so please do everyone a favor and start using `inputmode` on
your input for a better experience for all of us.

For example if the user is suppose to fill in number in an input use `inputmode="numeric"` and the
