This is a small script I use to resize and shrink size of images through unix terminal.

```bash
for file in *.jpg; do convert $file -strip -resize 2660x\> -quality 80 "`basename $file .jpg`-resized.jpg"; done
```

The script will resize all jpg images in the folder to a max-width of 2660px and a quality of 80 and
also remove all metadata from the image. Simple to modify to your needs. This will also keep the
original images.

If you want to override the original images you can use the following script.

```bash
for file in *.jpg; do convert $file -strip -resize 2660x\> -quality 80 "$file"; done
```

For this to work you need to have `imagemagick` installed on your system.
[imagemagick on Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/imagemagick)

```bash
brew install imagemagick
```
