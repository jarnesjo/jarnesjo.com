This is a small script I use to resize and shrink size of images through unix terminal.

```bash
setopt nullglob; for file in *.{JPG,jpg,jpeg}; do convert $file -strip -resize 2660x\> -quality 80 "`basename $file .jpg`-resized.jpg"; done
```

The script will resize all jpg images in the folder to a max-width of 2660px and a quality of 80 and also remove all
metadata from the image. Simple to modify to your needs. This will also keep the original images.

The `setopt nullglob` is for `zsh` to prevent the script from stop if on the first error it encounters.

If you want to override the original images you can use the following script.

```bash
setopt nullglob; for file in *.{JPG,jpg,jpeg}; do convert $file -strip -resize 2660x\> -quality 80 "$file"; done
```

Another way to write this is to use `find` instead of a for loop. In this example your do not need to use
`setopt nullglob` and it will also work in `bash`.

```bash
find . -type f \( -iname "*.jpg" -o -iname "*.jpeg" \) | while read file; do
    echo "Converting $file"
    convert "$file" -strip -resize 2660x\> -quality 80 "$file"
done
```

For this to work you need to have `imagemagick` installed on your system.
[imagemagick on Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/imagemagick)

```bash
brew install imagemagick
```
