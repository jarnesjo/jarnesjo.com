Working with numbers, currency and other units can be a real pain itself. Then add locale to it the
headache gets real.

There for when I found `Int.Numberformat()` I totally fell in love ❤️

## Currency

Say for example you have have a number, price, you want to present in locale specific way you have
to know specific formatting where to put space ,`,`, `.` or the currency symbol and so on.

Lets take a look at a price in EURO and we want to present if to our Swedish audience first

```js
console.log(new Intl.NumberFormat('sv-SE', {style: 'currency', currency: 'EUR'}).format(123456.789))
// 123 456,79 €
```

Then want to present it to our friends in USA

```js
console.log(new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {style: 'currency', currency: 'EUR'}).format(123456.789))
// €123,456.79
```

Amazing isn't it! It's just works.

## Units

It's alls work with units too. For example `liter`, `kilometer-per-hours` and combine it with
`unitDisplay: 'long'` and you will get in correct singular and plural.

```js
console.log(
  new Intl.NumberFormat('sv-SE', {
    style: 'unit',
    unit: 'kilometer-per-hour',
    unitDisplay: 'long'
  }).format(50)
)
// 50 kilometer per timme
```

### Caveat

Safari don't have fully support for other units then `currency`, `decimal` and `percent` both
desktop and iOS right now.

Is Safari starting to be the new IE?
