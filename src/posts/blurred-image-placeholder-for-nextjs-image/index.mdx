<Image

  alt="Blurred image as placeholder beside real image"
/>

As seen in gif above (a bit distorted) is what I have accomplished described in the post below. And
on this image below you can see the blurred image which is a base64-encoded image loaded first and
it's created from the image to the right with a webpack-loader.

<Image
  src="next-image-blurred-placeholder.png"
  width={1464}
  height={578}
  alt="Blurred image as placeholder beside real image"
/>

**UPDATE**  
It was initial written about `lqip-loader` but after some npm vulnerabilities and lack of support
and decided to rewrite it and luckily found `lqip-modern-loader`. So updated content follows

<hr />

When I started using Next.js for the first time for real were just in break between version 9
and 10. So when I heard they should include a new optimized image component I were excited.

It's nice when the framework adds things like this which is build together with framework and
optimized for it. But as in many cases it could missing features you thought would be nice to have.
One of those things are some sort of placeholder for the image before it's loads because of the lazy
loading.

I have experiment with a lot of other npm packages such as `next-optimized-images` and got to know
lqip for the first time. So why didn't I went that way? It have it's pros and cons as `next/image`
and I want to stick to it and see how it evolves and in my opinion feels a bit more future-proof.

## The solution

So the solution were that it implemented a webpack loader which gives me a base64 string of the
image I can add into a wrapper together with `next/image` which is absolute positioned and when the
image loads it will appear above the placeholder and you will get the illusion they are stitched
together.

```bash
npm install lqip-modern-loader --save-dev
```

Add the `lqip-modern-loader` into the _next.config.js_ and it will provided you with the base64
image which we uses in our custom image component.

```js:next.config.js
module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, options) => {
    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /\.(gif|png|webp|jpe?g)$/i,
      use: [
        {
          loader: 'lqip-modern-loader'
        }
      ]
    })
    return config
  }
}
```

We still using the Next.js pattern to store our images into the `public`-directory and when we're
doing the required we are loading it through our newly added webpack loader.

```tsx:CustomImage.tsx
import Image, {ImageProps} from 'next/image'

const CustomImage = ({src, ...props}: ImageProps) => {
  const image = require(`../public${src}?lqip`)

  return (
    <div className="relative overflow-hidden flex rounded-none sm:rounded-md">
        <img
          src={image.dataURI}
          className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full transform scale-110 m-0"
          style={{filter: 'blur(20px)'}}
          aria-hidden="true"
          alt=""
        />
      <Image src={image.src} {...props} />
    </div>
  )
}

export {CustomImage}

```

Here you can see an example of what you will get back from
`` const image = src.startsWith('http') ? {src} : require(`../public${src}?lqip`) ``

```json
// const image = src.startsWith('http') ? {src} : require(`../public${src}?lqip`)
// console.log(image)
{
  "src": "/_next/static/media/home-office.0484ab3be39e7d374d77eea012746d12.jpg",
  "width": 24,
  "height": 18,

}
```

And an example of the CustomImage component in use. Still needing every necessary properties as
`next/image`

```jsx
<CustomImage
  src="/static/images/home-office.jpeg"
  alt="My computer desk at home"
  width="4032"
  height="3024"
/>
```

## Caveats

One problem with this solution are that it's **only supports jpg and png** at the moment. And to
have fallback solutions is to add another webpack loader `file-loader`.

```bash
npm install file-loader
```

We then update `next.config.js` with the following code

```js:next.config.js
module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, options) => {
    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /\.(gif|png|webp|jpe?g)$/i,
      use: [
        {
          loader: 'lqip-modern-loader'
        }
      ]
    })

    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /\.(svg|png|jpe?g|gif|webp|mp4)$/i,
      use: [
        {
          loader: 'file-loader',
          options: {
            publicPath: '/_next',
            name: 'static/media/[name].[hash].[ext]'
          }
        }
      ]
    })

    return config
  }
}
```

Update the `CustomImage`-component to support fallback source for not supported image types.

```tsx:CustomImage.tsx
import Image, {ImageProps} from 'next/image'

export type CustomImageType = ImageProps & {
  noPlaceholder?: boolean
}

const CustomImage = ({src, noPlaceholder, ...props}: CustomImageType) => {
  const image = src.startsWith('http') ? {src} : require(`../public${src}?lqip`)

  return (
    <div className="relative overflow-hidden flex rounded-none sm:rounded-md">
      {image.dataURI && !noPlaceholder && (
        <img
          src={image.dataURI}
          className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full transform scale-110 m-0"
          style={{filter: 'blur(20px)'}}
          aria-hidden="true"
          alt=""
        />
      )}
      <Image src={image?.src || image.default} {...props} />
    </div>
  )
}

export {CustomImage}
```

As you seen above I have added support for external images and also added the property
`noPlaceholder` if you have transparent images and it be a bit weird when you get a blurred image
behind it. So with new prop you have opt-out the placeholder.
