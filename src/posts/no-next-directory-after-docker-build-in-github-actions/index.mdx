### TLDR; Version

Could be your node version if you using a `alpine` version.

<hr />

When I posted my latest post here I got some super weird behavior. Everything seems to work and
build as normal. But couldn't reach the site.

When I did a `docker logs jarnesjo.com` on the container I saw the following error message.

```
Error: Could not find a production build in the '/opt/app/.next' directory. Try building your app with 'next build' before starting the production server.
```

Ok so I did restart of the container and check whats init before it got killed and did saw the
`.next` directory in there. Super weird!

The build works and could be started locally but something is going wrong in GitHub Actions. So it
kind a hard to debug if you have to deploy and wait for the build steps to go through and don't see
any obvious errors.

After hours of debugging I took a look into the `.next` directory in the deployed and failed
container and found following

```json
➜  ~ docker exec jarnesjo.com ls -lart ./.next

total 16
-rw-r--r--    1 nextjs   nodejs         662 Nov 19 13:03 routes-manifest.json
drwxr-xr-x    3 nextjs   nodejs        4096 Nov 19 13:03 cache
drwxr-xr-x    3 nextjs   nodejs        4096 Nov 19 13:03 .
drwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          4096 Nov 19 13:03 ..
```

Took a look into my local build to see how it should look like

```json
➜  ~ docker exec jarnesjo.com ls -lart ./.next

total 60
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Nov 19 13:56 server
drwxr-xr-x 6 root root 4096 Nov 19 13:57 static
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    2 Nov 19 13:57 react-loadable-manifest.json

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   93 Nov 19 13:57 export-marker.json
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Nov 19 13:57 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Nov 19 13:57 ..
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Nov 19 14:00 cache
```

Something going very wrong here. Ok how to tackle it?  
I started with notice I use `node:lts-alpine`. Ok so no hard version dependency so changed it to
`node:14-alpine` instead but with the same result.

After many turns I finally stop worrying about a small build so changed to `node:14` and after that
everything worked as expected.

Super annoying debug that just popped up from nowhere but hope this can helps if you getting same
error.
