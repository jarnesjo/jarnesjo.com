This is a small script I use to convert images from example avif to webp through unix terminal. In
this case because Microsoft Edge does not support avif images yet. I learned the hard way.

```bash
`for image in ./*/*.avif ;  do convert "$image" "${image%.*}.webp" ; done`
```

For this to work you need to have `imagemagick` installed on your system.
[imagemagick on Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/imagemagick)

```bash
brew install imagemagick
```
