I really love GitHub Actions but have find it hard to develop sometimes. You make changes and then
push it and see if you getting the result you expected.

But today I did find a nice plugin/program for develop workflows locally and doing all the try and
error stuff locally.

You can find it on [https://github.com/nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) with good
documentation how to use and check out theirs
