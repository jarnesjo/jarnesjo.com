I just want to share my Github action config for continuous integration (CI) of a Gatsby JS site to
Digital Ocean.

And ok it mostly for my own sake because I forget everything and want a cheatsheet to go back to,
but hope it can help anybody because I couldn't find it when Googling.

```js:.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml
name: Build and Deploy
on: push
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    name: Build deploy Gatsby site
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          cache: "npm"

      - name: Install project dependency
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build Gatsby
        run: npm run build

      - name: Verify
        run: ls -la public

      - name: rsync deployments
        uses: burnett01/rsync-deployments@5.1
        with:
          switches: -avzr --delete
          path: public/*
          remote_path: "${{ secrets.DEPLOY_PATH }}"
          remote_host: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_HOST }}
          remote_user: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_USER }}
          remote_key: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}

```

If you have work with Github actions before it's kind of self explaining.

You have to add your deploy secrets under `Settings -> Secrets` in your project.

`DEPLOY_PATH` - Full path on Digital Ocean server example `/home/domain-to-site.com`  
`DEPLOY_HOST` - IP address to Digital Ocean droplet  
`DEPLOY_USER` - SSH user to login to the droplet  
`DEPLOY_KEY` - SSH secret and the public key should be added to `.ssh/authorized_keys` on server

**Important about SSH keys**  
`DEPLOY_KEY` holds the private SSH key so best way is to create a new pair for just this actions.
You do so in terminal with `ssh-keygen` and put it in some temporary directory and naming. **Do
not** use the default naming and place it that case you may overwrite existing key. The private key
you put into the Github secrets and the private key you add to your Digital Ocean droplet into
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. You can do so by copy and paste by editing the file with
`nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` - `CTRL+O` and the `CTRL+X`

If you found this helpful and deployed a site with it please send me a tweet with the url.

Happy deploying!
