I did a small project where I didn't needed a big framework just for simple landing page as
version 1. But then I was reminded about the caching problems and how every framework takes care of
it for you. But I still wanted to keep it simple and not add a lot of dependencies.

So I did a small script that I run after I have built the project that adds a version number to the
CSS file and then replace the link in the HTML files. It's not perfect but it works.

I'm using Tailwind CSS in the project and this is the cache-busting file to cache bust the two
HTML-files the project contains.

```js:cache-busting.js
const fs = require("fs")

const cssFile = "./src/style.css"

const version = fs.statSync(cssFile).mtimeMs
const replacement = `href="./style.css?v=${version}" rel="stylesheet"`

const searchRegex = /href=\".\/style\.css\?v=.*\"/g

fs.readdirSync("./src").forEach((file) => {
  if (file.endsWith(".html")) {
    const htmlTemplate = fs.readFileSync(`./src/${file}`, "utf-8").replace(searchRegex, replacement)
    fs.writeFileSync(`./src/${file}`, htmlTemplate, {
      encoding: "utf-8",
    })
  }
})
```

I then added the script to the `package.json` file that minified the TailwindCSS and also cache
bust. Simple and effective.

```json:package.json {4}
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "npx tailwindcss -i ./src/css/tailwind.css -o ./src/style.css --watch",
    "build": "npx tailwindcss -o ./src/style.css --minify && node ./cache-bust.js"
  },
}
```
