When it's was time to create a sitemap for this site I started googling and found a good resource on
[Leerob.io](https://leerob.io/blog/nextjs-sitemap-robots), which is a great resource for Next.js
content. Mine solution is very similar, but I have a bit different approach so why not share my take
on it too.

First of all we have to install `globby` for getting files and directories which we're going to use
to build up our sitemap.

```bash
npm install --save-dev globby
```

Then we can take a look at the magic file doing all the work for us. I will the break it down in
more detail and explaining a bit more in this post.

```js:./scripts/generate-sitemap.js
const fs = require('fs')

const globby = require('globby')
const prettier = require('prettier')

;(async () => {
  const pagePaths = await globby(['pages/**/*.tsx', '!pages/_*.tsx', '!pages/api'])
  const pageRoutes = pagePaths
    .filter(pagePath => !pagePath.includes('[slug]'))
    .map(pagePath => pagePath.replace('pages', '').replace('.tsx', '').replace('/index', ''))

  const postPaths = await globby(['posts'], {onlyDirectories: true})
  const postRoutes = postPaths.map(postPath => postPath.replace('posts', '/blog'))

  const allRoutes = [...pageRoutes, ...postRoutes].sort()

  const sitemap = `
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  ${allRoutes
    .map(route => {
      return `
      <url>
      <loc>${`https://jarnesjo.com${route}`}</loc>
      </url>
      `
    })
    .join('')}
    </urlset>
    `

  const prettierConfig = await prettier.resolveConfig('./.prettierrc')
  const formatted = prettier.format(sitemap, {
    ...prettierConfig,
    parser: 'html'
  })

  fs.writeFileSync('public/sitemap.xml', formatted)
})()
```

Now I'm going to go through the file and explain everything in a bit more detail and why it's
written the way it is.

```js
const pagePaths = await globby(['pages/**/*.tsx', '!pages/_*.tsx', '!pages/api'])
const pageRoutes = pagePaths
  .filter(pagePath => !pagePath.includes('[slug]'))
  .map(pagePath => pagePath.replace('pages', '').replace('.tsx', '').replace('/index', ''))
```

Here we are looking through our `pages`-directory for pages to include in the sitemap. We are
grabbing every file that ends with `.tsx`. But we are not interested in to getting Next.js specific
files which starts with `_` in filename such as `_app.tsx` or `_document.tsx`. We are also ignoring
the whole `api`-route because we don't getting any benefit or makes no sense to include that.  
After that we're filtering out files including `[slug]` which also make no sense to include when
it's a dynamic route and that itself will point nowhere. We will fix that later on when we're adding
the blogposts to the sitemap.

```js
const postPaths = await globby(['posts'], {onlyDirectories: true})
const postRoutes = postPaths.map(postPath => postPath.replace('posts', '/blog'))
```

After that we're getting all our posts which in my case following this structure

```
pages/
posts/
├── unbalance-sound-on-mace/
│   ├── index.mdx
│   └── unbalance-sound-on-mace.png
└── blurred-image-placeholder-for-nextjs-image/
    ├── index.mdx
    ├── blurred-placeholder-animation.gif
    └── next-image-blurred-placeholder.png
public/
scripts/
```

And therefor we're only interested in the directories which is the one containing the slug to the
article and which we want to add to the sitemap. We then replace the `posts` part of the relative
path to the directory with the part the blog are presented under in my case `/blog` and there we
have all routes for now that will be included in `sitemap.xml`.

```js
const allRoutes = [...pageRoutes, ...postRoutes].sort()
```

Then we just merging this twos of arrays and I like order so I sort them too. Every developer loves
order, right?

```js
const sitemap = `
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  ${allRoutes
    .map(route => {
      return `
        <url>
          <loc>${`https://jarnesjo.com${route}`}</loc>
        </url>
      `
    })
    .join('')}
  </urlset>
  `
```

Then we are looping over all our routes and stitching it together to output-string which we later
saves to file.

```js
const prettierConfig = await prettier.resolveConfig('./.prettierrc')
const formatted = prettier.format(sitemap, {
  ...prettierConfig,
  parser: 'html'
})
```

This part are some sort of unnecessary but I like it to be clean and when I already have `prettier`
in my project I use it to get better and nicer structure.

```js
fs.writeFileSync('public/sitemap.xml', formatted)
```

And then we saves everything to file in the public directory and which can be submit to for example
Google Search Console.

Last but not least we adds a bit of magic to our `next.config.js` file which allows the whole thing
to be dynamic and make the whole thing get generates when we are using `next build`.

```js:./next.config.js
module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, {isServer}) => {
    // Done on build
    if (isServer) {
      require('./scripts/generate-sitemap')
    }

    return config
  }
}
```

And the output will look something like this

```xml:./public/sitemap.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <url>
    <loc>https://jarnesjo.com</loc>
  </url>
  <url>
    <loc>https://jarnesjo.com/about</loc>
  </url>
  <url>
    <loc>https://jarnesjo.com/blog</loc>
  </url>
  <url>
    <loc>https://jarnesjo.com/blog/blurred-image-placeholder-for-nextjs-image</loc>
  </url>
  ...
</urlset>
```
