More then once I have changed name on a file and then deployed it and then discovered something
broke the deploy. And in some of this cases was because git didn't pick up my renaming of some file
but the references got changed.

And this because macOS isn't case sensitive but Linux are and here is where the mismatch is
happening.

So my go to solution for this has been either copy the source of the file deleted it and made a
commit and then added it back with correct name. Or change it some stupid name commit and the change
again to my preferred name and commit again ðŸ™„

So instead of doing (which isn't working)

```bash
mv defaultLayout.tsx DefaultLayout.tsx
```

I found out you can do it with `git mv`

```bash
git mv defaultLayout.tsx DefaultLayout.tsx
```

and git will pick up and everything works as expected ðŸ‘Œ
