Maybe you thought it was some problems with your headphones as I thought and started a support
ticket with Bose. But after hours of investigation I found out that the sound was unbalanced in the
macOS – everything because a long lasting bug. It’s could happens when you press volume buttons when
your Mac’s CPU is under heavy load.

A very annoying bug that should have been fixed long ago but I supposed it’s so few that really
notice it and therefor no one really cares – sadly.

The solution I found was to install an app called
[Balance Lock](https://www.tunabellysoftware.com/balance_lock/) that will help you keep your volume
locked and balanced and if it drift away the app will correct it for you.
